# IDC_21days-SQLChallenge
### 21-day Challenge for SQL by IDC [Indian Data Club] sponsored by DPDzero
In this Repo, I have uploaded day-wise challenges and their solution by my approach.<br> The main aim is to improve SQL knowledge by doing problems and improving our approach and improve logic building
#### About data set:
Its a hospital data set. There are total 4 tables.
<br> 1. hospital_staff.csv – List of hospital staff
<br> 2. hospital_patients.csv – Patient records
<br> 3. hospital_service_weekly.csv – Weekly service-level data
<br> 4. hospital_staff_schedule.csv – Weekly schedule

#### Challenges Lists
First create data base and table structure using the [Code](./Create%20Database,%20Table%20Structures)

- **Day 1** : List all unique hospital services available in the hospital.[Code](./Codes_daywise/Day%201_IDC.sql)
- **Day 2** : Find all patients admitted to 'Surgery' service with a satisfaction score below 70, showing their patient_id, name, age, and satisfaction score.[Code](./Codes_daywise/Day%202_IDC.sql)
- **Day 3** : Retrieve the top 5 weeks with the highest patient refusals across all services, showing week, service, patients_refused, and patients_request. Sort by patients_refused in descending order.[Code](./Codes_daywise/Day%203_IDC.sql)
- **Day 4** : Find the 3rd to 7th highest patient satisfaction scores from the patients table, showing patient_id, name, service, and satisfaction. Display only these 5 records.[Code](./Codes_daywise/Day%204_IDC.sql)
